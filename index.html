                <header>What is Web 3?</header>
                <p>Starting with <code>Web 1.0</code>, the static era, we moved to the dynamic and interactive landscape of <code>Web 2.0</code>.</p>
                
                <p>Now, we are on the verge of another paradigm shift with <code>Web 3.0</code> the decentralized web. It promises to transform how we view and interact with digital platforms.</p>
                
                <p>But what exactly is Web 3? It's often dubbed as the "decentralized web". Unlike its predecessors, Web 3 champions peer-to-peer interactions, reducing the middlemen in the process.</p>
                
                <p>The backbone of Web 3 is the <code>blockchain technology</code>. It provides the framework for trustless transactions, smart contracts, and dApps (decentralized applications).</p>

                <header>Why the Surge in Interest for Web 3 Development?</header>
                
                <p>This surge in interest isn't merely because of the tech's novelty. It offers tangible benefits like enhanced user data control, new monetization methods, and the promise of a more equitable digital space.</p>

                <header>Challenges and Opportunities:</header>
                
                <p>As you might expect, with vast potential comes its set of challenges. The decentralized nature demands a novel approach to application design, data management, and user engagement.</p>
                
                <p>Thus, being a Web 3 developer isn't just about coding. It's about embracing a new philosophy, a fresh perspective on how web platforms should function and serve their users.</p>
